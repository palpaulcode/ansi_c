# C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE - ANSI C
This repositry contains code from the aformentioned book

## 1-hello.c
The first step to learning any new language starts by printing these two famous words-'hello, world'
That's what the code in this file does.

## 2-example.c
This program uses the formula C=(5/9)(F-32) to print a table of Fahrenheit temperatures and their Celcius equivalents

## 2-example_v2.c
Modifies example 2 to use values of floating point precision type.

## 3-temp converter.c
Temperature converter program using a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop.

## 4-symbolic_constants.c
A `#define` line define symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of charcters. 
Format:
	`#define name replacement text`
This script uses this format to define the constants to use for the temperature conversion program.

## 5-file_copy.c
This program copies its input to its output one character at a time

## 6-file_copy_v2.c
Copies its input to its output like above, but uses a more condensed code form

## 7-character_counting.c
This program counts characters input by the user until a EOF is entered then it prints the number of characters entered.

## 8-character_counting_v2.c
Counts cahracters like the above program, but uses a `for` loop in its counter.
